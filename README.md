## Firmware

[Companion app](https://github.com/zzeneg/qmk-hid-host) for Raw HID communication.

#### QMK

Please see main `config.h` and `rules.mk` for comments and available options.

- [pre-compiled files](https://github.com/zzeneg/vial-qmk/releases/tag/zzeneg)

#### Compiled versions

> Each firmware name has two modules, first is on the left side, second on the right, e.g. if your keyboard has Azoteq on the left and round display on the right - choose `azoteq-round`

- keymaps:
  - `default` - sample keymap with home row mods. Not recommended for longer use - create your own.
  - `hid` - default keymap with HID support. Requires companion application.
  - `zzeneg` - my highly customized layout.
- hardware versions:
  - `-rect-` - rectangular display (ST7789 240x280)
  - `-round-` - round display (GC9A01 240x240)
  - `-flat-` - flat 40mm Cirque
  - `-curved-` - curved 40mm Cirque
  - `-azoteq-` - Azoteq TPS43

> [!WARNING]
> For 38keys version with VIK display adapter - redefine LCD pins in `config.h` as in 40keys version

## VIK - MX38/MX40 versions only ⚠️

> [!NOTE]
> VIK is a standard for a data interface between printed circuit boards. It is intended to provide modularity between a mechanical keyboard PCB and additional features.

**[1]**: I2C and SPI use same pins, so you can use only one or the other, not both. Selection is configured in firmware.

**[2]**: PCB has pads designed for 1206/3216 SMD resistors, you can solder them manually if needed.

#### VIK usage

Built-in display and trackpad use the same interface, so any additional VIK module will have to replace one of them (it's possible to combine other I2C modules with Azoteq). Depending on the size it can integrated into the cover or a standalone case.

All possible connectors support VIK - FPC horizontal on the back, FPC vertical on the front and the breakout pins.
